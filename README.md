## How tf does it work?
It just appends code to app.py and then it all works! Ur welcome!!!

## Notes:
### HTML File structure:
- The script gets all files ending with .html, so only put files that it can read, and understand as .html
- The root page filename is empty (so its ".html")
### CSS:
- Reading css FILES isint supported (i guess) sice idk how flask works with css
- U can still include css in ur html code!
### La Script:
- it may not be 100% reliable...
- Havent done big testing on it, thats why its public rn

### Usage:
- Overall, Dont use it! (Unless you ask me and i say yes)
- But if i give permission then you can use it
- But if u use it without permission i will come to ur house
- I know where you live

#### This is really simple... Learn to code if u actually need this, its made for sites with over 40 pages.
